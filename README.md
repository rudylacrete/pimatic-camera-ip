pimatic-camera-ip
=======================

A simple not yet terminated plugin to display a camera IP stream directly into pimatic.

ROADMAP:
- added AST actions for the condition engine to be able to take pictures
- added more options to make the plugin compatible with more configurations (authentication, resolution, ...)
- improve the UI
